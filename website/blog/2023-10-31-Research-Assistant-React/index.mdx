**TL;DR:**

* We introduce **ARA - AutoGen Research Assistant**, a React based web application to help people do research with the assistance of AutoGen agents. Think of ARA as a starter application to help you think about how to develop rich web experiences with the AutoGen framework.

* We showcase examples of `Skill Creation` to demonstrate basic teachability and later recalling the skills in subsequent chats to perform tasks.

* We showcase an example of `Personalization` to demonstrate basic adaptation and using that to learn user preferences.

## Introduction

The AutoGen Research Assistant (ARA) is a conversational assistant powered by AI agents built using the Autogen framework. ARA helps people perform research tasks ranging from literature reviews, to data analysis, to report generation via a simple chat-based interface.

Here are a few ways ARA can help you do research::

1. **Brainstorming Partner:** Powered by conversable AutoGen agents, ARA can engage in natural language dialogues with you and other agents to brainstorm ideas or think through complex concepts.

2. **Research Facilitator:** Leveraging AutoGen agents that can use tools, ARA can help you search the web, gather and organize information, or analyze data to make well-informed decisions.

3. **Content Creation:** Using AutoGen agents that can use tools and produce and execute code on your behalf, ARA can help create research artifacts like reports, tables, and graphs.

The goals of the ARA sample application include demonstrating how AutoGen agents can help people solve complex tasks, and how to build a React-based web application with the AutoGen framework along with GATSBY and TailWind. ARA also demonstrates two experimental features:

AutoGen framework along with GATSBY and TailWind. ARA also demonstrates two experimental features:

* **Skill Learning**: To reduce the time and effort to complete repetitive tasks, such as conducting literature reviews or creating different types of graphs, you can teach ARA skills and recipes which it can reuse in the future.
* **Personalization**: To personalize ARAâ€™s behaviors, you can ask it to generate a bio of your preferences and needs based on previous conversations which it can then use to tailor future content it generates.

## Run It Yourself

ARA can be run as a standalone web application. All the conversation and data stays on your local machine.

Please use the [README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/apps/README.md) to get a jump start on the application.

## Capabilities

This demo focuses on the research assistant use case with some generalizations

* **Skills**: The agent is provided with a list of skills that it can leverage while attempting to address a user's query. Each skill is a python function that may be in any file in a folder made availabe to the agents. We separate the concept of global skills available to all agents `backend/files/global_utlis_dir` and user level skills `backend/files/user/<user_hash>/utils_dir`, relevant in a multi user environment. Agents are aware skills as they are appended to the system message. A list of example skills is available in the `backend/global_utlis_dir` folder. Modify the file or create a new file with a function in the same directory to create new global skills.

* **User Keywords**: The research assistant also accepts explicit keywords that trigger specific behaviors.
  * `@execute` : This app is designed such that code execution is an explicit request from the end user. For example, the agents are setup to not execute generated code by default. Rather, the user can respond with `@execute` to execute the most recent code block or make modifications.
  * `@memorize`: The app also supports an `@memorize` key word that runs a workflow where a new python skill is synthesized based on the recent conversation history. This is intended as an example of teachability where an agent can learn reusable skills.

## Example Usage

A set of example queries are shown below, with the intent of demonstrating the capabilities of the research assistant.

> Note that this specific workflow will require a model with large context length (gpt-4-32k recommended) as abstracts from multiple papers are retrieved and inserted into the conversation history.

```
Find arxiv papers that show how are people studying trust calibration in AI based systems
```

The agents respond by _writing code_ to conduct a literature search and utilizes an existing skill `find_relevant_papers` in the global skills dir `backend/files/global_utlis_dir/lit_review_mod.py`.

```python
# python code
from lit_reviewer_mod import find_relevant_papers

research_question = "How are people studying trust calibration in AI based systems?"
papers = find_relevant_papers(research_question, max_papers=10)

for i, paper in enumerate(papers):
    print(f"\nPaper {i+1}:")
    print(f"Title: {paper['title']}")
    print(f"Authors: {', '.join(paper['authors'])}")
    print(f"Published: {paper['published']}")
    print(f"Summary: {paper['summary']}")
    print(f"PDF URL: {paper['pdf_url']}")
```

In response, the user can type `@execute` which causes the code to be executed and the response returned.

Next, the user can request modifications to the code:

```
analyze the above abstracts, list 4 high level application domains studied by these papers. Add subdomains as necessary
```

The user can then ask for formatting updates:

```
Generate a markdown table: domain, paper title, url
```

![ARA](./img/ara_markdown.png)

```
Use this data to generate a bar chart of domains and number of papers in that domain. Save it to a file named barchart.png.
```

This generates code for the chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
domains = ['Human-AI Collaboration', 'AI-Assisted Decision-Making', 'Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)', 'Explainable AI (XAI)']
num_papers = [4, 4, 1, 1]

# Create bar chart
plt.bar(domains, num_papers)
plt.xlabel('Domain')
plt.ylabel('Number of Papers')
plt.title('Number of Papers in Each Domain')

# Save the chart as an image file
plt.savefig('barchart.png')
```

The user can then execute the suggested code by typing `@execute`.

![ARA](./img/ara.png)

Following this, the user can also type `@memorize` which triggers a workflow that synthesizes a new skill function that captures the recent history of interactions. This new skill is saved in a file `backend/files/user/<user_hash>/utils_dir`.

## Planned improvements

## Conclusion

`ARA` is still under active research and development. For any problems you find or improvements you have in mind, please join our discussions in this repo and on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/pAbnFJrkgZ). We look forward to seeing how you and the rest of the community can use different agents and create new web based experiences with AutoGen!
