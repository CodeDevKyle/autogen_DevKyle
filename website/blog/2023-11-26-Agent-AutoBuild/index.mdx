**TL;DR:**
Introducing **AutoBuild**, building multi-agent system automatically, fast, and easily for complex tasks with minimal
user prompt required, powered by a new designed class **AgentBuilder**. AgentBuilder also support open-source LLMs by
leveraging [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).
Checkout example notebooks and file for reference:

## Introduction
In this blog, we introduce **AutoBuild**, a pipeline that can automatically build multi-agent system for complex task.
Specifically, we design a new class called **AgentBuilder**, which will complete the generation of participant expert agents
and the construction of group chat automatically after the user provide descriptions of a building task and a execution task.

AgentBuilder support open-source models on Hugging Face powered by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html)
and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Once the user choose to use open-source LLM, AgentBuilder will set
up an endpoint server automatically without any user participant.

### Pipeline
The pipeline of AutoBuild can be separated as: initialize, build, and start, with corresponding function.
