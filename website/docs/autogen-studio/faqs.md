# AutoGen Studio FAQs

**Q: How do I specify the directory where files(e.g. database) are stored?**

A: You can specify the directory where files are stored by setting the `--appdir` argument when running the application. For example, `autogenstudio ui --appdir /path/to/folder`. This will store the database (default) and other files in the specified directory e.g. `/path/to/folder/database.sqlite`.

**Q: Where can I adjust the default skills, agent and workflow configurations?**
A: You can modify agent configurations directly from the UI or by editing the [dbdefaults.json](autogenstudio/utils/dbdefaults.json) file which is used to initialize the database.

**Q: If I want to reset the entire conversation with an agent, how do I go about it?**
A: To reset your conversation history, you can delete the `database.sqlite` file in the `--appdir` directory. This will reset the entire conversation history. To delete user files, you can delete the `files` directory in the `--appdir` directory.

**Q: Is it possible to view the output and messages generated by the agents during interactions?**
A: Yes, you can view the generated messages in the debug console of the web UI, providing insights into the agent interactions. Alternatively, you can inspect the `database.sqlite` file for a comprehensive record of messages.

**Q: Can I use other models with AutoGen Studio?**
Yes. AutoGen standardizes on the openai model api format, and you can use any api server that offers an openai compliant endpoint. In the AutoGen Studio UI, each agent has an `llm_config` field where you can input your model endpoint details including `model`, `api key`, `base url`, `model type` and `api version`. For Azure OpenAI models, you can find these details in the Azure portal. Note that for Azure OpenAI, the `model name` is the deployment id or engine, and the `model type` is "azure".
For other OSS models, we recommend using a server such as vllm to instantiate an openai compliant endpoint.

**Q: The server starts but I can't access the UI**
A: If you are running the server on a remote machine (or a local machine that fails to resolve localhost correstly), you may need to specify the host address. By default, the host address is set to `localhost`. You can specify the host address using the `--host <host>` argument. For example, to start the server on port 8081 and local address such that it is accessible from other machines on the network, you can run the following command:

```bash
autogenstudio ui --port 8081 --host 0.0.0.0
```
