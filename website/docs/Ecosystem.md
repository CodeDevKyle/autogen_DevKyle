## MemGPT + AutoGen


![Agent Chat Example](img/ecosystem-memgpt.png)

MemGPT enables LLMs to manage their own memory and overcome limited context windows. You can use MemGPT to create perpetual chatbots that learn about you and modify their own personalities over time. You can connect MemGPT to your own local filesystems and databases, as well as connect MemGPT to your own tools and APIs. The MemGPT + AutoGen integration allows you to equip any AutoGen agent with MemGPT capabilities.

## Semantic Kernel + AutoGen

Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this by allowing you to define plugins that can be chained together in just a few lines of code. With Semantic Kernel, you can easily bring Plugins to agents so they can do more than just talk.
