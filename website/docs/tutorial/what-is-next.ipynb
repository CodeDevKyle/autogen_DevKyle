    "1. **Chat with LLMs**: In [Human-in-the-Loop](./human-in-the-loop) we covered\n",
    "    the basic human-in-the-loop usage. You can try to hook up different LLMs\n",

    "    and chat with them\n",
    "    using the human-in-the-loop component of your human proxy agent.\n",
    "2. **Prompt Engineering**: In [Code Executors](./code-executors) we covered the\n",
    "    simple two agent scenario using GPT-4 and Python code executor. To make this\n",
    "    scenario work for different LLMs and programming languages, you probably need\n",
    "    to tune the system message of the code writer agent. Same with other scenarios\n",
    "    that we have covered in this tutorial, you can also try to tune system messages\n",
    "    for different LLMs.\n",
    "3. **Complex Tasks**: In [Conversation Patterns](./conversation-patterns)\n",
    "    we covered the basic conversation patterns. You can try to find other \n",
    "    tasks that can be decomposed into these patterns, and leverage the \n",
    "    code executors to make the agents more powerful.\n",
