    "# Command Line Code Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "Command line code execution is the simplest form of code execution. Generally speaking, it will save each code block to a file and the execute that file. This means that each code block is executed in a new process. There are two forms of this executor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker ([`DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/docker_commandline_code_executor#dockercommandlinecodeexecutor)) - this is where all commands are executed in a Docker container\n",
    "- Local ([`LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/local_commandline_code_executor#localcommandlinecodeexecutor)) - this is where all commands are executed on the host machine\n",
    "\n",
    "This executor type is similar to the legacy code execution in AutoGen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor`](/docs/reference/coding/docker_commandline_code_executor#dockercommandlinecodeexecutor) will create a Docker container and run all commands within that container. The default image that is used is `python:3-slim`, this can be customized by passing the `image` parameter to the constructor. If the image is not found locally then the class will try to pull it. Therefore, having built the image locally is enough. The only thing required for this image to be compatble with the executor is to have `sh` and `python` installed. Therefore, creating a custom iamge is a simple and effective way to ensure required system dedendencies are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the executor as a context manager to ensure the container is cleaned up after use. Otherwise, the `atexit` module will be used to stop the container when the program exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspecting the container\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to keep the container around after AutoGen is finished using it for whatever reason (e.g. to inspect the container), then you can set the `auto_remove` parameter to `False` when creating the executor. `stop_container` can also be set to `False` to prevent the container from being stopped at the end of the execution.\n",
