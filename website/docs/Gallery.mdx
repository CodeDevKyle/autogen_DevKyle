## Contributing

To contribute, please open a PR that adds an entry to the `data/gallery.json` file in the `src` directory. The entry should be an object with the following properties:

```js
{
    "title": "AutoGen Playground",
    "link": "https://huggingface.co/spaces/thinkall/AutoGen_Playground",
    "description": "A space to explore the capabilities of AutoGen.",
    "image": "default.png",
    "tags": ["web", "app"]
  }
```

The `image` property should be the name of a file in the `static/img/gallery` directory. The `tags` property should be an array of strings that describe the demo.
