    "# Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is a software entity that communicates via messages, maintains its own state, and performs actions in response to received messages or changes in its state. \n",
    "\n",
    "AgentChat provides a set of preset Agents, each with variations in how an agent might respond to received messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent inherits from a `BaseChatAgent` class with a few generic properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: The name of the agent. This is used by the team to uniquely identify the agent. It should be unique within the team.\n",
    "- `description`: The description of the agent. This is used by the team to make decisions about which agents to use. The description should detail the agent's capabilities and how to interact with it.\n",
    " \n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "How do agents send and receive messages? \n",
    "\n",
    "AgentChat is built on the `autogen-core` package, which handles the details of sending and receiving messages. `autogen-core` provides a runtime environment, which facilitates communication between agents (message sending and delivery), manages their identities and lifecycles, and enforces security and privacy boundaries. \n",
    "AgentChat handles the details of instantiating a runtime and registering agents with the runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about the runtime in `autogen-core`, see the [autogen-core documentation on agents and runtime](../../core-user-guide/framework/agent-and-agent-runtime.ipynb).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent also implements an `on_message` method that defines the behavior of the agent in response to a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CodingAssistantAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "Generates responses (text and code) using an LLM upon receipt of a message. It takes a `system_message` argument that defines or sets the tone for how the agent's LLM should respond."

    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, modern LLMs can now accept a list of available tool schemas (descriptions of tools and their arguments) and generate a tool call message. This capability is known as **Tool Calling** or **Function Calling** and is becoming a popular pattern in building intelligent agent-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on tool calling, refer to the documentation from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up a ToolUseAssistantAgent in AgentChat, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the tool, typically as a Python function.\n",
    "2. Wrap the function in the `FunctionTool` class from the `autogen-core` package. This ensures the function schema can be correctly parsed and used for tool calling.\n",
    "3. Attach the tool to the agent.\n",
