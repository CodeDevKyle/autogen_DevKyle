Recipe Name: Analyzing and Visualizing Research Papers in Different Domains

Steps:

Define the research question.
Use the find_relevant_papers function from the lit_reviewer_mod.py file to find relevant papers based on the research question.
Analyze the abstracts of the papers to categorize the application domains.
Generate a markdown table with the domain, paper title, and URL for each paper.
Generate a bar chart of domains and the number of papers in each domain and save it to a file, using `generate_bar_chart`.
Here are the generalized Python functions for the coding steps:

Non-coding steps:

# The assistant needs to define the research question.
# After finding the papers, the assistant needs to analyze the abstracts of the papers to categorize the application domains without code.
# The assistant needs to input the domains and the number of papers in each domain to the generate_bar_chart function.

When using this recipe, only start with code for the first coding step. Never use hypothetical or synthetic data.
