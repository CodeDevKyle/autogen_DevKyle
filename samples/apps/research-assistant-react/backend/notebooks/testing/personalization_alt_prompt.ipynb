    "Adam Fourney is a researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond. Adam did his PhD at the University of Waterloo, studying problems at the intersection of HCI and information retrieval. His dissertation studied how people use web search to support their broader information work, such as using complex software, or programming. Since joining Microsoft, Adam has adapted his research to study similar questions, but about the use of large generative language models like GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In research, and at home, Adam is a builder: he builds and tests prototypes, is proficient in Python, C, SQL, web development, Linux, and other tools of the trade. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Adam creates visualizations or writes visualization code, he prefers visualization charts with no borders , no gridlines and a legible  bolded title in each chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "His prototypes are not limited to software and extend to physical prototyping with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, etc. He often applies these skills to his other hobbies including photography, and outdoor activities such as biking, hiking and camping. As an example, building rigs for timelapse, stereo, and arial kite photography.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interacting with Adam, know that he prefers direct concise communication. In writing, this translates to using an active voice, and limiting run-on sentences. Important points should be called out visually such as via bullet points of other emphasis. In programming, this means that code should be well-documented, with appropriate in-line comments. Code should be written for readability, avoiding clever syntax tricks, deeply nested list comprehensions, etc. Since Adam frequently switches between machines and operating systems,  Adam values portability, preferring built-in libraries over complex external dependencies.\n",
