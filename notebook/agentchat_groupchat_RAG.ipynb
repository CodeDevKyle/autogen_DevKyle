      "To use the `flaml.distributed` module, you need to have a working Apache Spark cluster. You also need to install PySpark and set up the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable before running the code above. This example assumes that you have a Spark cluster running locally. If you want to run the code on a remote cluster, you need to modify the `master` parameter when creating the `SparkSession` object.\n",

You can enable MLFlow autologging with the `mlflow.autolog()` function and log specific information manually using MLFlow inside or outside `flaml.tune` or `flaml.automl`. After you manually start a parent run, the MLFlow integration feature will be enabled, regardless of whether autologging or manual logging is used. \n",

      "\n",
      "Once you've manually started a parent run, FLAML's MLFlow integration feature will enable you to log distributed experiments on Spark. Additionally, tags will be logged automatically, such as `flaml.best_run`, `flaml.run_source`, `flaml.version`, and `flaml.metric`. For AutoML experiment, additional tags will be logged, such as `flaml.estimator_name`, `flaml.estimator_class`, `flaml.learner`, and `flaml.sample_size`.\n",
