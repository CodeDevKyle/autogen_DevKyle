      "Autologging is managed by MLFlow, while manual logging is maintained by FLAML.\n",
      "\n",

      "#### Details of Manual Logging\n",
      "FLAML logs general artifacts for AutoML tasks. Specifically, we log these artifacts:\n",
      "\n",
      "**`flaml.tune`**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "![Manual Log Example for Tuning](Images/manual_log_tune.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- We create a parent run to log the best metric and the best configuration for the entire tuning process.\n",
      "- For each trial, we create a child run to log the metric specific to the tune function and the configuration for that trial.\n",

      "**`flaml.automl`**\n",
      "\n",

      "- We create a parent run to log the results of the experiment. This includes:\n",
      "  - The configuration of this model.\n",
      "  - The `best_validation_loss` produced by this model.\n",
      "  - The `best_iteration` to identify the point at which this model was found.\n",
      "- For each state (a specific learner with different hyperparameters), we record the best trial for this model. This includes:\n",
      "  - The configuration of the best trial.\n",
      "  - The `validation_loss` the best trial produces.\n",
      "  - The `iter_count` to identify how many trials we have conducted for this state.\n",
      "  - The `pred_time`, which is the time cost of predicting test data for this model.\n",
      "  - The `wall_clock_time`, which is the time cost of this state.\n",
      "  - The `sample_size` to show how much data we sampled in this state.\n",

      "The `flaml.visualization` module provides utility functions for plotting the optimization process using [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/). Leveraging `plotly`, users can interactively explore experiment results. To use these plotting functions, simply provide your optimized `flaml.AutoML` or `flaml.tune.tune.ExperimentAnalysis` object as input. Optional parameters can be added using keyword arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avaliable plotting functions:\n",
      "- `plot_optimization_history`: Plot optimization history of all trials in the experiment.\n",
      "- `plot_feature_importance`: Plot importance for each feature in the dataset.\n",
      "- `plot_parallel_coordinate`: Plot the high-dimensional parameter relationships in the experiment.\n",
      "- `plot_contour`: Plot the parameter relationship as contour plot in the experiment.\n",
