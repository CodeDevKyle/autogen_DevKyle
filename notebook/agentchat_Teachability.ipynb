    "# Chatting with TeachableAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can even demonstrate in-context learning of things that the user teaches the assistant during the chat. But these memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats, the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TeachableAgent` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory (a vector database). Memory is saved to disk at the end of each chat, then loaded from disk at the start of the next. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the agent just once, and have the agent remember them in later chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `TeachableAgent` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` to analyze pieces of text in several different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how `TeachableAgent` can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. To chat with `TeachableAgent` yourself, run [chat_with_teachable_agent.py](../test/agentchat/chat_with_teachable_agent.py).\n",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.\n",

      "Innovation: The paper reports the investigation of GPT-4, an AI model by OpenAI, claiming it to possess more general intelligence than previous models. It's capable of performing a wide range of tasks spanning different domains including mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, and psychology, delivering near-human performance in many of these tasks without needing specific prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Empirical Results: GPT-4 greatly outperforms prior models like ChatGPT and provides a glimpse into what early versions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems may look like. Despite its depth and breadth of capabilities, the paper acknowledges the need to re-evaluate the current predictive model approach and potentially pursue a new paradigm for AGI. It closes with a consideration of societal implications of such technology and future research directions.\n",

      "1. Firstly, I start with looking at the integer '9' from the multiplicative term '9 * 4'. The product is 36. If I were to increase this product to a value closer to 99 without going over, I would find the number 24. Because 24 * 4 is 96, which is closest to 99. The equation becomes: 24 * 4 + 6 * 6 = 96 + 36 = 132 which exceeds 99. \n",
      "2. Second, I check '4' from the multiplicative term '9 * 4'. Its product is 36 as well. If I increase this product, the number I find is 22 because 9*22 is 198, which is furthest from 99. Temporarily, this option seems incorrect.\n",
      "3. Thirdly, I consider '6' from the additive term '6 * 6'. Its product is 36. I realize I can't increase this product without exceeding 99.\n",
      "4. Finally, I evaluate the other '6' from the multiplicative term '6 * 6'. Its product is 36 as well. Here, I found the solution. If I change this '6' to '3', the sum of the products becomes 99. 9*4 + 6*3 = 36 + 18 = 54.\n",
