About half of the MIR AGNs are in mergers but it is unclear\\nwhether mergers are the main trigger. For the X-ray and SED AGNs, mergers are\\nunlikely to be the dominant trigger. We also explore the relation using the\\ncontinuous AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$ parameter. Mergers exhibit a clear excess of\\nhigh $f_{AGN}$ values relative to non-mergers, for all AGNs. We unveil the\\nfirst merger fraction $f_{merg}-f_{AGN}$ relation with two distinct regimes.\\nWhen the AGN is not dominant, the relation is only mildly increasing or even\\nflat, with the MIR AGNs showing the highest $f_{merg}$. In the regime of very\\ndominant AGNs ($f_{AGN}\\\\geq0.8$), $f_{merg}$ shows a steeply rising trend with\\nincreasing $f_{AGN}$ for all AGN types. These trends are also seen when plotted\\nagainst AGN bolometric luminosity.
