Specifically, our building pipeline include `init()`, `build()`, and `start()`. In `build()`, we prompt a gpt-4 model to create multiple participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this task need programming to solve. After that, user can call `start()` at a proper time to complete the task. "
