      "3. File naming: The code saves the downloaded papers using the paper title as the filename. However, the paper titles may contain characters that are not allowed in filenames. It would be better to sanitize the title and replace any invalid characters before saving the file.\n",

      "3. Markdown formatting: The code uses the `to_markdown()` function from the pandas library to save the DataFrame as a markdown table. However, this function does not provide much control over the formatting of the table. It would be better to use a library like `tabulate` or `prettytable` to generate a more customizable markdown table.\n",
